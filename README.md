# cardboard box

A scrappy 6-button LED dance pad emulating a Dance Dance Revolution pad — can be used for rhythm games like **Friday Night Funkin'** and other 4-key movement games. Includes **Enter** and **Escape** keys on top of the standard WASD/Arrow layout.

Built for **Hack Club Undercity** because we thought it'd be fun and my friend won't stop playing FNF IDK TBH.
